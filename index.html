          <h3> Bio </h3>
          <p>
            My name is Nicole! I am a university student interested in the art of film. My passion has always been film. I’ve wanted to be a film director from a young age and although my focus has shifted slightly, I’m still yearning to be in the film industry. I’m always looking for ways to improve my skills and excel as a filmmaker.

          <h3> Process Analysis 1 </h3>
          <p>
            In the spring semester of 2017 I took a course called New Media Images which was an introductory film class. For the final project, students formed teams of 3-4 and were tasked with making a narrative short film between 5-8 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            My group decided on doing an adaptation of a short story called Psychosis by Matt Dymerski. Over the course of roughly 4 weeks my team had to do everything from writing the screenplay to post production. My main role was to direct and edit our film. I had to work around my group's different schedules to set up times where we could all meetup to film.
          </p>
          <p>
            I directed my small team making sure we got several takes of each scene from different angles and lighting to ensure we had some options when putting together the final product. We had to plan out a lot of details before meeting up to film so that our time was used efficiently and we weren't wasting time figuring out how to film certain shots on the day of.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since everyone on my team had different schedules, we didn't have a lot of days where we could dedicate to filming and therefore had to make sure we got everything we needed in those few precious days. There were scenes in our film that required us to yell and be loud so we had to get these done in as few takes as possible since our filming location was in an apartment building and we didn't want to upset the neighbours.

          <h3> Process Analysis 2 </h3>
          <p>
            For the final project of a course I took in 2015 called Information Design I had to redesign one section of the Craigslist website. We worked in teams of two to recreate a section of Craigslist using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Part of the assignment required that we make the website adaptable so that it could be viewed on a computer monitor, tablet, or mobile device.
          </p>
          <p>
            My partner and I had to redesign the jobs section of Craigslist from scratch, meaning we had to write all the code required for the website to function. We started with HTML to build the basics of the site, then used CSS for the cosmetic appearance of the website and finally we used JavaScript to implement the website's adaptability.
          </p>
          <p>
            We ran into the most problems when working with JavaScript and making things react properly when in desktop vs mobile mode. We had to do a lot of research, testing and re-coding parts of the script to finally make it work the way we intended.
