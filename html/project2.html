            <h3> Process Analysis 2: Website Redesign </h3>
            <h4> summary </h4>
            <p>
              For the final project of a course I took in 2015 called Information Design I had to redesign one section of the Craigslist website. We worked in teams of two to recreate a section of Craigslist using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Part of the assignment required that we make the website adaptable so that it could be viewed on a computer monitor, tablet, or mobile device.

            <h4> process </h4>
            <p>
              My partner and I had to redesign the jobs section of Craigslist from scratch, meaning we had to write all the code required for the website to function. We started with HTML to build the basics of the site, then used CSS for the cosmetic appearance of the website and finally we used JavaScript to implement the website's adaptability.
            </p>
            <h4> challenges </h4>
            <p>
              We ran into the most problems when working with JavaScript and making things react properly when in desktop vs mobile mode. We had to do a lot of research, testing and re-coding parts of the script to finally make it work the way we intended.
