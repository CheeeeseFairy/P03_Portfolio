            <h4> summary </h4>
            <p>
              In the fall semester of 2019 I took an upper division film course and one of the projects was to create a 30 second short film that represented ourselves as unique filmmakers that included visual style, as well as special effects. I chose to do a video about the process of making tea, because anyone who knows me knows that tea is an integral part of who I am.
            </p>

            <h4> process </h4>
            <p>
              I originally started out with a completely different idea for my film. My first idea was to recreate a sort of "character creation" like you would see in a video game. However, after I started filming this I realized I only had one static long shot of myself and this was not visually dynamic, so I scrapped this idea and went back to brainstorming. I then came up with the idea to film the process of making tea because it is such an essential part of my morning routine and who I am. I quickly sketched out some of the shot ideas I had and then got to filming the next day.

              After filming all my shots in the span of about 2 hours, I compiled the footage in Adobe Premiere Pro. I used a series of jump cuts to condense all my footage into the 30 second time limit and ended up leaving out a lot of the shots I took. Once I had arranged the clips in a sequence I liked I moved the project into After Effects where I added the text animations.

              We started by making the website for a basic desktop web browser and then made to make it adaptable to make the content shift in a way that it would still look good and be functional on a mobile or tablet screen. One part of this was making a "hamburger menu" appear once the screen was smaller than a certain size.

            <h4> challenges </h4>
            <p>
              My main struggle with this project was creating the special effects. I wasn't sure what kind of effects I could add that would enhance my piece which led me to including only very basic text animations and some video overlays.

            <h4> reflection </h4>
            <p>
              Overall, I'm happy with how my film turned out, but I would have preferred making it without the special effects. I feel like since I'm not yet skilled with special effects that it took away from the film. However, I'm very happy with how the different shots turned out and flowed together well within the 30 second time limit.
