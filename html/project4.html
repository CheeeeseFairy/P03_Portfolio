            <h4> summary </h4>
            <p>
              This magazine spread was a project I completed in an introductory graphic design course in my first semester at Simon Fraser University in 2014. For this assignment I worked with a partner, Melody, to create a three page magazine spread for interior design. We also had to make a version of the magazine spread for the web. This project was meant to get an understanding of how content is arranged in a magazine and how to use Adobe inDesign.

            <h4> process </h4>
            <p>
              My partner and I tried different layouts for our magazine spread, rearranging photos and text to find the one that looked best. We searched for the images we used online and chose ones that had a similar feel and style to ensure our magazine was cohesive.

            <h4> challenges </h4>
            <p>
              One of the challenges I encountered was finding high resolution images for our spread. I wanted to make sure the images were as clear and sharp as possible to produce the best results when the magazine spread was printed. This led to making compromises on certain images because I would have to make them smaller scale on the page if I couldn't find a high resolution version, or I would simply have to not include it in the spread.

            <h4> reflection </h4>
            <p>
              This project improved my page layout design skills by going through the iterative process of reorganizing content on a page to see how different things can be group together depending on placement and how the eye moves around a page. For a first attempt at doing a magazine spread, I am proud of how our final product turned out.
