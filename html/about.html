                Hi, my name is Nicole! I am a student at Simon Fraser University in the Interactive Arts and Technologies program who aspires to work in the film industry. I have been interested in film since I was a child and always dreamed of being a director. Although my focus has shifted slightly, I still yearn to work in this creative industry.
              </p>
              <p>
                My passion comes from films that have strong narratives and use unique cinematography and editing to create a cohesive piece. I take inspiration from film directors like Quentin Tarantino, and shows such as Breaking Bad and try to implement some of their creative film techniques into my own work.
              </p>
